# UI Bootcamps - Node.Js

##Agrego una linea
![Globant](assets/globant.jpg)

## __IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER__
This is not your typical _crash course_, this is a **Bootcamp**.

What does that mean?

- _You will give your best_

- _We will give our best_

- _We will all have a good time_


But most important, there will be **A LOT** of humor, because a happy developer _(student, pupil, padawan, you get the point...)_ is a great and hard working developer.


_That said..._


## Welcome to the bootcamp, learning time has begun

![Workout](assets/workout.gif)

Please, use this repository as a base for all your work. The idea is to
fork this project so everyone uses the same folder structure for the
exercises.

### Handling Advanced Developers

Developers that move faster than average can go ahead and complete as much
exercises as wanted.

→ [index](#index)

### Materials

1. You will need to install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Version 10) (NVM is strongly recommended - [Unix](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation)/[Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows))

2. The recommended IDE is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). However, you can use any IDE of your preference.

3. Gmail Account + headset (For hangout calls)

4. Create your own [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. Follow
this [guideline](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) to setup your
account. Also you can read further about Git in
[Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) or
[Learn Git Branching](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/)

5. Fork this repo to use as a base to host the project code.

→ [index](#index)

### Bootcamp Schedule

The Bootcamp is organized in the following way:

![Calendar](assets/calendar.png)

TBD

The last week will be focused on starting an app and learning some _shiny cool_ stuff. You need to present your work at the end of the week, _however_
you can keep working on it (more on that later).

→ [index](#index)

### General Guidelines

1. [Team play](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/ten-qualities-of-an-effective-team-player.html) is encouraged but the work will be evaluated per person.

2. The instructions will be vague as they generally are in real life projects.
You must look for support and guidance from your PM, teammates and tutors.

3. All code and documentation must be in English.

4. `Js` code must adhere to Globant's [Js Style Guide](https://github.com/globant-ui/JavaScript-style-guide).

→ [index](#index)

### Learning Days ###

Each day you will grab the fundamentals of building blocks for usual
`Node` applications.

On each learning day you will have to:

1. **Read:**
We will provide you with documentation related with current sprint content so
you can have a background reference, guide and examples to complete the
following practice.

2. **Practice:**
You will implement the previously gathered knowledge in simple coding activities.

3. **Commit:**
You will commit all your code on a daily basis, when you finish your practice. This will not apply for code of Week 4.

→ [index](#index)

## Introduction

  - This repository contains inside the `src` directory the project structure for all exercises/challenges that you will
  need to do.

  - All `.js` code can be opened directly on the console. You can start a node process with `node PATH_TO_FILE`

  - A `start` script will be needed for processes. That should be used as `npm start`

  - [Basic GIT concepts](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

_Now let's get down to business_

## Week 1: Knowing your Node
### Chapter 1: Intro
So you want to learn Node.js? Cool, I guess you already know JS, why would you be here if not?
Ok, you can always refresh some stuff [here](https://github.com/globant-ui/angular-bootcamp#day-3---5-hello-javascript)

So, now that we are on the same page let's start with the basics

>_Node.js is Javascript that runs on the server_

![What?](./assets/what.gif)

Yes, that's it. It uses Google's engine, (yes, Javascript runs on an engine) called [__V8__](https://v8.dev/) and you don't need a browser to use it.

 - [REPL](https://hackernoon.com/know-node-repl-better-dbd15bca0af6)

### Chapter 2:  Basics
Let's talk shop.

Node just runs Javascript, but you actually need more than that to make an app. You need some kind of code modularization,
some kind of debugging tool and, of course, other people's code :grimacing:.

## Week 3: From REST to TEST
### Chapter 5: Getting

 - REST
 - Express
 - Middlewares
 - Validations
#### REST

OK, now, we're going to take a REST.

![RESTDAY](./assets/rest-day.png)

Oh, no, we're not talking about THAT rest. We're talking about this REST:

![RESTfulAPI](./assets/restful-api.png)

REpresentational State Transfer

##### And... what does it means?

It means when a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource.
The representation of the state can be in a JSON format, and probably for most APIs this is indeed the case. It can also be in XML or HTML format.

What the server does when you, the client, call one of its APIs depends on 2 things that you need to provide to the server:
- An identifier for the resource you are interested in. This is the URL for the resource, also known as the "endpoint".
- The operation you want the server to perform on that resource, in the form of an HTTP method, or verb. The common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

##### EXPRESS

Express is the most popular Node web framework. It provides mechanisms to:

- Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).
- Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.
- Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response.
- Add additional request processing "middleware" (we're going to talk about that later) at any point within the request handling pipeline.

### Chapter 6: Testing
You've been doing apps, exercises, REST APIs. But how can you make sure that what you did will actually work on every scenario?

_It works if I use `1`, but if I input `-1` it breaks_

What about `0`? and `---1`?

It's pretty annoing having to run the app for each case. Now imagine you are working on a team, 5 or 10 people, each of you adding new code and removing old. How can you make sure that everything is still working as expected? I guess you see the problem.

But don't panic, here comes Unit Testing to the rescue

![Unit Test](./assets/unit-test.gif)

#### Excercise:
Remember the first reading material, [Testing in Node](https://hackernoon.com/a-crash-course-on-testing-with-node-js-6c7428d3da02)?
You should have a test project done, right? Well go to [chapter_6](/exercises/chapter_6) and follow the instructions.

## Week 4: Store and Deploy
### Chapter 7: Storing
 - [SQL Databases](#SQL-Databases)
 - Postgres
 - Sequelize

### SQL Databases

 - [Connecting to MySQL through Docker](https://medium.com/coderscorner/connecting-to-mysql-through-docker-997aa2c090cc)

### Chapter 8: Preparing for Production
Knowledge? _CHECK_

App? _CHECK_

Test? _CHECK_

Is the app production ready?

![Confused](./assets/confused.gif)

An app is production ready when you are able to provide a working instance that complies with the requirements of the problem.

_Can't I just take the folder where the development work was made and use that?_

__NO!__ Well... yes, _but that's not the correct way to do that._

Modern apps should behave as [SaaS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/what-is-saas/) and the best way to do that is being compliant with [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/).

Yes, I know that 12 steps sounds like _a lot_ but it's not that complicated. We are going to concentrate on the basic tools to make your Node app _production ready_

#### Excercise:
There is no excercise for this class, you should be focusing on the [Final Project](#final-project). Remember, you should apply all the knowledge from this and previous chapters on it.

 → [index](#index)

## Final Project:

![Show Me What You Got](assets/challenge-accepted.gif)

**_It's time to make an app from scratch_**
We're going to continue with the exercise from chapter_7. We'll use a new branch named `final-exercise`.
```
~/bootcamp-node/final-project$ git checkout -b 'final-exercise'

~/bootcamp-node/final-project$ git push origin final-exercise
```

### First
- Add some unit tests to get, at least, 75% of code coverage. :)

### Second
- Dockerize the API
- Use .env to define some env vars

**_Hey, don't panic. This excercise is for week 4 and on..._**

You have until the last day of week 4 to keep pushing changes. After that you can keep workin on the app, but please create a new branch for it:
```
~/bootcamp-node/final-project$ git checkout -b 'post-bootcamp'

~/bootcamp-node/final-project$ git push origin post-bootcamp
```

**Some advices**
- Dont't get scared. Even the most successfull Software Engineers and Architects forget things sometimes.
- Google is your friend, independence and curiosity are great values that every developer needs to have.
- The only way to learn is to fail, so keep failing.
- Theory is nice, but you need to get your hands dirty if you want things to stick.
- Remember, _a happy developer is a great developer_ (_also_, **coffee** is your best friend)

Kudos and keep ~~failing~~ learning!

# BONUS

So... you've got your `Node` going, you read a **LOT** of stuff. So... What's next?

![Nerd](assets/nerd.gif)

There're still a lot of stuff to read, some of them really work better under specific conditions or requirements. Remember:

_KEEP IT SIMPLE_

If there's a more advanced or complicated way to get to a solution it doesn't always mean that's the better approach.

With that in mind, here are some more advanced _(or not, this **whole** beatifull mess was made by a bored developer on a few days span)_ features that every one should know, and at least being able to explain them.

- [Socket IO](https://socket.io/)
- [No SQL Databases](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
- [Caching](https://medium.com/@danielsternlicht/caching-like-a-boss-in-nodejs-9bccbbc71b9b)

Hey, If you need a place to kill time try [Medium](https://medium.com), there's a lot to read about pretty much anything (specially development related topics).
